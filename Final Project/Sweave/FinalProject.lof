\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces Colony dynamics for the system of equations (a,c) with corresponding parameters on the right side graphs (b,d). Dashed lines represent forager death rate, while solid black line represents percent allocation of resources to reproductive rearing. Forager death rate used here is a monotonic linear combination of second degree polynomial functions. The parameters in (a,b) represent a bet-hedging approach and those in (c,d) represent the "bang-bang" strategy with transition point such that all energy can be converted to reproductives.}}{11}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces Illustration of the effects of a changing resource availability on within-season colony dynamics. These systems consist of the same strategies and forager death rates used in figure 2\hbox {}, the only difference being resource availability. Long-dashed lines are resource availability (energy per forager per day) with the systems in figure 2\hbox {} using a constant 2 energy per forager per day. Short-dashed lines represent forager death rate, solid black line represents percent allocation of resources to reproductive rearing. Forager death rate used here is monotonic, a combination of polynomial functions.}}{12}

Associated parameters are illustrated on the right (B,D). The provisioning strategy presented here is monotonic, with high provisioning in the early season. }}{14}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5}{\ignorespaces Illustration of system dynamics under slight variation of parameters. (A,B) show effects of slight (10\%) variation of resource availability in middle and late season, respectively. Similarly, (C,D) shows effects of 20\% variation in energy preservation in middle and late season. Line types represent a single system for each plot, with parameter values increasing beginning at the solid line. Reproductives increase with increasing resource availability, while they decrease with increasing energy provisioning.}}{15}
